# chrome-tab-saver
Created by Jordan Macias

## Purpose
This extension allows the user to select multiple tabs and save their URL locations for viewing at a later time. After saving the selected tabs are closed to clear screen clutter and system memory. The user can then recall previously saved sessions through a dropdown menu. Sessions can be accessed from any device where the user is logged in to their Google account.

## Installation
To install this extension, open Google Chrome and navigate to "chrome://extensions/". Enable "Developer mode" at top-right then click "Load unpacked extension...". Navigate to and select the project folder "chrome-tab-saver". The extension should immediately load, being visible in the main list and its browser action icon to right of the omnibox.
